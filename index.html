    <p>Imagine this: you're standing in your kitchen, scrolling through endless online recipes, trying to decide what to make for dinner. You're looking for something that fits your keto diet, doesn't trigger your allergies, and pairs beautifully with that bottle of wine you’ve been saving. Sounds like a daunting task, doesn't it? This is where most meal planning apps fall short. They either offer generic recipes that don't cater to specific dietary needs or lack the sophistication to suggest food and wine pairings.</p>
